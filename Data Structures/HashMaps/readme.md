-> Definition : 
    > HashMap is a type of data structure which is used widely in the domain of DEV and have a very less Time Complexity for the operations of Insertion, Deletion and Searching.

-> Ordered vs Unordered Map
    > UnOrdered Map stores the data in an unordered / unsorted order. Time Complexity is O(1) i.e constant time complexity
    > Ordered Map stores the data in an ordered / sorted order. Time Complexity is O(log n)

-> Insertion : 
    > Insertion is only done for unique keys and if duplicate key found then it will only update it instead of creating a duplicate key.

-> Collision : collision is a condition where there is another key that will be mapped to an occupied slot.

-> Collision Handling : 
    > Open Hashing
    > Closed Addressing
